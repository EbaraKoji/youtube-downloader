00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
The web as we know it today has 
become incredibly important.  

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,200
But it's not without its problems. In 2017,  

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,680
28 years after the web was conceived, Sir Tim 
Berners-Lee wrote about 3 trends that worried him.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,360
The first one was that we've lost 
control of our personal data.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,840
Many websites today offer us a free 
service in exchange for our data.  

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
But we're not given a choice. Want to 
use Facebook? Then you have to accept  

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,240
their terms and conditions, and that includes 
how it collects, stores, and uses your data.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,760
Others do the same thing, and that 
means that our data is scattered  

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,440
all over the place. Some companies even sell 
your data to third-parties behind your back.

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,760
We have no idea what happens with our 
data, and we have no control over it.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,440
To solve this problem, the inventor of the web 
is working on Solid. It's not a new internet,  

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
but rather an extension of the web as we know it.  

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,480
You don't need anything special to 
use it. Any web browser will do.

14
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,000
The goal of Solid is to take all your data -- that  

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,040
is scattered around -- and centralize it in 
a single place that's under your control.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,360
In Solid, this place is called a "pod", and it can 
store any data. Your contact information, files,  

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,200
photos, basically all the data that you produce 
and all data that others produce about you.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Your pod gives you fine-grained control over 
your data. You can choose what you share,  

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
with whom you share it, and you can 
revoke that permission at any time.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,840
Here's a concrete example. Today, social 
networks store all your data on their servers.  

21
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,160
But a social network built on Solid 
would keep your data in your pod.  

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,680
So whenever you post something, 
it goes into your pod.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,520
Now, having all your data in one 
place has interesting side-effects.

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,400
For starters, you could allow 
multiple apps to access the same data.

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,520
For example, I use Spotify to listen to music,  

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
and over the years, I have built an entire 
library there. Spotify uses this data,  

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,880
along with my listening history, to understand my 
tastes in music and help me discover new songs.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
And here's the problem: 
Spotify locks up that data.  

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I can move to Apple Music, but that 
would mean re-building my library  

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
and waiting for them to learn my music tastes 
before it can give me good recommendations.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
Tim Berners-Lee calls this data 
"silos", where each company  

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,800
builds its own data store and protects it from 
others—giving them a competitive advantage.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,280
If these services ran on Solid, my music library 
and listening history would be stored in my pod.  

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Switching services is then easy. Just allow 
the new service to access the same data,  

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,480
and we're off to races.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,800
This means that Solid can help to level the 
playing field. Allowing small developers  

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,560
to compete with the big ones because 
they can have access to the same data.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,240
On a technical level, this is done with 
vocabularies, a mechanism to describe data  

39
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,600
so that many applications can understand it. 
It is almost like standardized file formats,  

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,680
like PDF, JPG, or MP3 files, which can be 
created and opened by many different apps.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,160
Another side-effect is that 
because your data is in one place,  

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,720
there's a single source of truth for 
everything. If you moved to a new place,  

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,720
you could change your address in your 
pod, and everyone that has access to it  

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,320
will see it—no need to go running around, changing 
your address in countless services and apps.

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
And finally, storing user 
data has become a liability  

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,520
because of privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA. 
Mishandle data, and you could be fined.

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,800
But storing data in the user's pod means 
you automatically comply with these laws.  

48
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,640
A user can always see what data is being 
stored. He can delete it and revoke access.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,240
But enough about these side-effects. Let's 
talk again about pods. How do you get one?  

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,920
Well, that's up to you. You can 
pick any provider you'd like.  

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
Maybe one with a good privacy policy 
or one that's hosted in your country.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
Or maybe you don't trust anyone 
and want to host your own.  

53
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
All of this is possible because the software 
is open-source and freely available.

54
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,360
But a pod is only a place to store 
data, and that's not enough. We also  

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
need a way to identify ourselves on 
the web. That's where WebID comes in.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,920
You can compare it to Login with Google or 
Facebook. Want to use a Solid application? Just  

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,840
login with your WebID. The key difference is that 
your WebID doesn't share data with third-parties.

58
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
We could see a future where governments give 
each citizen a WebID to access government-related  

59
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,600
services. You can have multiple WebID's, one 
issued by your government and a personal one.

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,800
The same is true for pods. Maybe you want 
a pod for personal data and one for work.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
But Solid isn't without 
challenges. Here are a few.

62
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,840
Let's start with monetization. Many services today 
are free because we pay for them with our data.

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Solid apps could replicate this, ask 
the user to give some of his data,  

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,520
and show targeted ads based on those. 
Nothing prevents a Solid app from doing  

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
that. The difference is that the user 
can revoke that access at any time.

66
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,680
Another solution could be to 
charge a fee to use the app.  

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,040
Or maybe offer both, and let users decide.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,840
Pod providers can do similar things. They can 
charge based on the amount of storage you use,  

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
or they could ask you to reveal some 
personal data in exchange for a free service.  

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
Or maybe, they could charge 
apps for using your data.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,680
I discussed this topic with Ruben Verborgh, 
a Decentralized Web Technology professor,  

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
and he puts it this way: "future companies 
should derive their value from the  

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,320
intelligence they provide". In other words: don't 
lock people in by taking their data hostage,  

74
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,840
but lock them in by providing 
the best service out there.

75
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
Another challenge for Solid is that 
once an app gets access to some data,  

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,880
it can copy it to another server. There's 
no technical solution that can prevent this.  

77
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,640
But there are legal ones, like the GDPR, 
which make it risky to copy personal data.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,200
Professor Verborgh notes that our 
current lack of privacy is a consequence  

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,920
of unsustainable business models. When 
the economics of personal data change,  

80
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,880
there'll be no reason to collect personal data 
other than the data already in the users' pod.

81
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,880
At this point, you might wonder: this is great. 
Can I use it today? Well, yes. It's still a work  

82
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,720
in progress, but there are many apps available 
and tools for developers to create Solid apps.

83
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,960
And, Solid itself is an open standard 
that everyone can contribute to.

84
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,320
One last thing before I end the video. I 
mentioned before that governments could provide  

85
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,680
pods and WebID's to citizens. In Belgium, 
the Flemish government wants to do just that.  

86
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
It has kicked off an ambitious project 
to form a data utility company.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
This company will centralize the 
citizen's data and put them in control.  

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,080
This could kick start the adoption of 
Solid while at the same time boosting  

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,840
the efficiency of government agencies 
because they no longer have to keep  

90
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,880
citizen data up-to-date across different 
systems. Everything is just in one pod.

91
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,800
I can't wait to see the next generation of 
apps and services built on Solid. Consider  

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,720
subscribing if you found this video interesting. 
Thanks for watching, and till next time!
